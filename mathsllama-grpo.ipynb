        "# The Art of Dynamic Rewards 🎯\n",
        "One key aspect of RL is that rewards shouldn’t just reinforce consistency—they should also push for growth. Imagine a student who starts off getting B’s—at first, the teacher might reward them to encourage progress. But if they keep getting B’s forever, the teacher needs to raise the bar, rewarding them only when they improve to an A or A+. In other words, rewards should be dynamic and adaptive, reinforcing positive surprises rather than maintaining the status quo. This ensures that learning doesn’t plateau but instead keeps progressing.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Some popular RL-based training methods are Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and GRPO. Let's see how each of these 3 approaches adjust the reward for model's continous improvemnt.\n",
        "\n",
        "- PPO, a traditional RL algorithm, relies on a critic network to estimate this baseline reward for an LLM. PPO is like a traditional classroom, where the teacher (the critic network) evaluates every student not just on their latest assignment, but based on their overall performance history. The teacher has an internal benchmark for each student—if a consistent B student scores another B, it’s expected so not a large reward assigned. But if that same student suddenly earns an A+, that’s a big deal and deserves extra recognition. On the flip side, if a straight-A student suddenly drops to a B, the teacher knows something went wrong. This structured approach helps maintain steady progress, but it also makes learning complex and slow because the teacher has to track every student’s past performance, adjusting expectations individually for each one.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- DPO simplifies learning by replacing the critic with direct preference comparisons, where the model learns by evaluating pairs of outputs ranked by human feedback. This pairwise comparison helps establish a relative reward context—similar to a student competing with a peer. If both students consistently receive similar grades, neither is performing exceptionally well; true excellence is only recognized when one significantly outperforms the other. However, this approach depends on a carefully curated preference dataset and is inherently limited by its two-output comparison framework.\n",
        "\n",
        "- GRPO simplifies learning by replacing the critic with a group-based comparison approach, where the model generates and evaluates multiple outputs at once rather than relying on pairwise comparisons. This enables the model to learn which responses are superior without needing a critic and without being limited to one-on-one assessments. An analogy would be evaluating a student’s performance relative to the entire class rather than just a single peer—providing a broader and more informative benchmark for assessing excellence. Also, unlike DPO, we don't need to create a preference dataset in advance - we let the model generate multiple answers for a given question and each answer will get a reward from the reward function and then adjust the rewards based on the mean and variance of these rewards - no need to involve human feedback!\n"

        "If you review the implementation of apply_chat_template in trl/data_utils.py, you'll notice that it expects both a \"prompt\" and a \"completion\" in the input. When provided, Hugging Face (HF) will automatically concatenate the prompt and completion to form the final input sequence for the model. However, this behavior is exactly what we want to avoid in our setup.\n",

        "Unlike Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), where exposing the answer in the completion is necessary for next-token prediction, our goal with reinforcement learning is fundamentally different. We do not want to show the answer to the model upfront. If we included the answer in the completion field, the model would simply learn to predict the next token based on the provided answer—defeating the purpose of encouraging autonomous reasoning.\n",
        "\n",
        "What we actually want is for the model to generate both the reasoning and the final answer on its own, starting only from the question. To achieve this, we deliberately avoid using the \"completion\" field. Instead, we store the ground truth answer separately in an \"answer\" field, which is ignored by the trainer’s apply_chat_template function. This way, the model receives only the question as input, and its output can then be evaluated using reward functions that check both the quality of reasoning and the correctness of the answer—without ever having been exposed to the answer during generation.\n",
